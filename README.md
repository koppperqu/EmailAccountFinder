# EmailAccountFinder
This project was created to provide a way to parse through all emails for an account to identify which services/websites have an account using that email.

My specific use case is the orignal email I used got leaked in a data leak about 10ish years ago. I have been fighting to take control of my accoutn ever since. I constantly have to deal with resetting my password. With this I will be able to identify all accounts associated with my email and then I will change the email associated with it.
